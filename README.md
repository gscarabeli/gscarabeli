# Hello, I'm Gustavo Correia Scarabeli (gscarabeli) 😁

### 📕 About me
I am a Computer Engineering student at Faculdade Engenheiro Salvador Arena in São Bernardo do Campo - SP, a field I have been passionate about since childhood. Currently, I work as a Full-Stack systems developer, specializing in C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL, and I am also learning Java and Dart.

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to my church, where I serve in the children's ministry. I have also helped in various other areas such as the media team, sound, cleaning, and the canteen. I have always enjoyed being helpful and assisting others. One of my strengths is my eagerness to learn; whenever I encounter something new, I dive deep into studying everything about it.

### 🌎 International Experiences
In 2022, June - July, I did an exchange in Canada, where I was able to develop professionally and advance a lot in proficiency in English, a language I fell in love with.
