# 👋 Hi, I'm Gustavo Correia Scarabeli

### 💻 About Me
I'm a Computer Engineering student at Faculdade Engenheiro Salvador Arena (FESA), currently working as a Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience in C#, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I'm passionate about building scalable, clean, and efficient software solutions — and I'm always expanding my skills, currently exploring Java and Dart.

Outside of coding, I enjoy volunteering at my church's children's ministry and supporting various community areas. I'm a naturally curious person who thrives on learning and helping others grow.

### 🌍 International Experience
In 2022, I completed an exchange program in Toronto, Canada, where I significantly improved my English fluency and gained a broader cultural and professional perspective.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- Advanced C# and .NET patterns
- Dart & Flutter for mobile
- Java and object-oriented design
- Cloud fundamentals (Azure & AWS)
