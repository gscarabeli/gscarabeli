# Hello, I'm Gustavo Correia Scarabeli (gscarabeli) 😁

### 📕 About me
I am a Computer Engineering student at Faculdade Engenheiro Salvador Arena in São Bernardo do Campo - SP, an area that I have been interested in since I was little. I currently work as a developer of Full-Stack systems, with an emphasis on C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS and SQL, in addition to studying Java and Dart. In my free time, I like to help the church to which I congregate, there I serve in the children's ministry, in addition to having helped in many other areas, such as the media team, sound, cleaning, in the canteen. I have always liked to be helpful and help others. A strong point about me is that every time I come across something new, I like to study everything about it.

### 🌎 International Experiences
In 2022, June - July, I did an exchange in Canada, where I was able to develop professionally and advance a lot in proficiency in English, a language I fell in love with.
